## Experience

For this lab I struggled with understanding what I was supposed to do. I got some idea on what I should do and that is to create a tutorial on how typeScript works and how it makes our job easier because it catches bugs before we run our code. I was able to form an outline in the index.html files that I will be working on.

## Known issues or Bugs

I did not experience any issues or bugs.

## Sources used
