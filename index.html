  <h1>What is TypeScript</h1>
      <div id="container">First things first TypeScript is not another language, it is used with 
        javaScript to help us catch errors before we run our code, which saves us a lot of time when we work 
      on our projects. </div>
      <div><img src="/images/typeScript.png" alt="typeScript" class="center"></div>
  <h1><strong>TypeScript</strong></h1>
      <div id="container">The relationship between javaScript and TypeScript is that whenever we declare a type in javaScript
        typescript will make sure that our variables are consistent with what they were declared for and some of those methods 
        will be mentioned below. 
      </div>
  <h2>Types by Inference</h2>
      <div id="container">TypeScript is familiar with JavaScript language and when you declare a variable, the value of that variable will be used 
        to as the type. When you try to use this variable later as a number then you will get an error because it's type 
        is a string.
      </div>
  <div><img src="/images/example1.png" alt="example1" class="center"></div>
  <h2>Defining Types</h2>
      <div id="container">Sometimes it is difficult for TypeScript to understand the type when you use object-oriented programming. In this 
        case you can use interfaces to tell javaScript what the type of the variables are.
        then use this interface.
        if an unknown property is used that is not included in the interface then it will give you an error.</div>
  <h2>Type and Union alias in TypeScript</h2>
      <div id="container">Using typescript you can create complex types using either Unions or Generics.
        For example you can type "type DoorStates = "open" | "closed" | "minimized" ".
        You can also pass a parameter that takes different types such as array or string when you
        pass a parameter to an object.
        We can figure out what type of variable by using the typeof: word.
        The other way is Generics.
      </div>
      <div><img src="/images/union.png" alt="interface" height="50" class="center1" ></div>
  <h2>Generics</h2>
      <div id="container">You can use generics to let your object or variables to be of any type.</div>
  <h2>Structural Type System</h2>
      <div id="container">TypeScript checks for the shapes of the values and if there are differences in the shapes 
        then it gives you an error.
      </div>
  <h2>Functions in TypeScript</h2>
      <div id="container">There are 3 different type of functions in javaScript and they include
        a regular function where you can use the word function and name the function,
      the other one is function expression, and the third one is arrow function. An arrow function has it's 
    parameters in the begging followed by its function statements. We can specify the types of the parameters 
  by use a colon and typing it's type such a string, number or boolean. We can also specify what our function should return by putting a colon after
  the parameters, that way it knows that the function must return a a particular type or it will 
  return an error.</div>
  <h2>Type definitions</h2>
      <div id="container">When you declare a constant variable then it cannot be changed, however when you declare it as let 
        it will show in typescript that the type of the variable is a string. We can hardcode a variable by typing 
        a colon before the name of the variable. 
      </div> 
  <h2>Interfaces in TypeScript</h2>
      <div id="container">Creating interfaces will help us avoid errors when try to create objects or classes 
        because it might miss an attribute and typescript will let us know. As you can see in the image below 
        that it will give us an error when we don't have an age attribute. It will also help us to auto complete 
        our attributes.
