  <h1><strong>TypeScript Tutorial</strong></h1>
  <p1>The relationship between javaScript and TypeScript is that whenever we declare a type in javaScript
    typescript will make sure that our variables are consistent with what they were declared for and some of those methods 
    will be mentioned below. 
  </p1>
  <h2>Types by Inference</h2>
  <p2>TypeScript is familiar with JavaScript language and when you declare a variable, the value of that variable will be used 
    to as the type. When you try to use this variable later as a number then you will get an error because it's type 
    is a string. 
    Sometimes it is difficult for TypeScript to understand the type when you use object-oriented programming. In this 
    case you can use interfaces to tell javaScript what the type of the variables are.
    then use this interface.
    if an unknown property is used that is not included in the interface then it will give you an error.
